# Adoption of GraphQL for Data Fetching

## Context
In our application, we are encountering issues with over-fetching and under-fetching of data when using traditional REST APIs. This results in inefficient network usage, slower performance, and increased complexity in managing multiple API endpoints.

## Decision
We propose adopting GraphQL for data fetching to address the issues related to over-fetching, under-fetching, and frontend data flexibility.

## Rationale
We choose GraphQL because it allows clients to specify exactly the data they require in a single query, reducing unnecessary data transfers and improving performance. GraphQL's flexible query language enables frontend developers to request only the data they need, simplifying data handling on the client side. Additionally, GraphQL supports dynamic queries, real-time updates, and aggregation of data from multiple sources, making it well-suited for our microservices architecture.

## Consequences
Pros:
- Reduced over-fetching and under-fetching of data, leading to improved network efficiency.
- Increased frontend flexibility, as clients can request precisely the data they need.
- Simplified data fetching in microservices architecture by aggregating data through a single GraphQL endpoint.

Cons:
- Initial implementation overhead for setting up the GraphQL server and defining schema and resolvers.
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with GraphQL syntax and concepts.

## Sample code GraphQL
```graphql
# Sample GraphQL query to fetch user data with specific fields
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    id
    name
    email
    posts {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```
